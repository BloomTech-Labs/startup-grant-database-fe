Founder Grants connects early stage founders, hackers, and tinkerers with the resources they need to create the next wave of technology.

We provide an easily searchable database of grants geared to those in the early technology field in one central repository.

### Key Features

- List of available grants
- Grant detail window
- Filter in real time
- Submit a new grant to the database

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

- React
- Redux
- Firebase
- Auth0
- Material UI

#### React

We chose React because it is:

- Modular and component based
- High speed (virtual DOM)
- Rich library and plugin ecosystem
- Great community and support

#### Redux

We chose Redux because it is:

- Easily compatible with React
- Best in class state management
- Scales well
- Great documentation

#### Firebase

We chose Firebase because it is:

- Depth and bredth of services
- Support and documentation
- Safety and security
- Ease of use

#### Auth0

We chose Auth0 because it is:

- Easy to integrate into application
- Scalability

#### Material UI

We chose Material UI because it is:

- Sleek and simple
- Lots of great solutions out of the box
- Customizable

#### Front end deployed to `Firebase`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/startup-grant-database-be) built using:

#### Node / Express

- JavaScript integration plays well with front end
- Simple but powerful
- Easily customizable with lots of plugins

# APIs

## [Auth0 Authentication API](https://founder-grants.auth0.com)

We used Auth0 for our authentication API. It provides user profiles with lots of scalable services and out of the box functionality.

## [Database API](https://grantly-staging.herokuapp.com/api/)

We have our back end database API deployed to Heroku. Heroku supports great PostgresSQL integrations which we use for the database and has great reliability.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

üö´These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_storageBucket - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_messagingSenderId - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_API - this is your public Stripe API key, generated in the Stripe dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development server
    *  REACT_APP_clientid - this is the Stripe_connect clientID, generated in Stripe_connect settings
